## Design
In our design there are three bounded contexts: Inventory, Service and Sales.
    1. Inventory
        - Manufacturer
            -Name 
        - Vehicle Model
            -Name
            -Photo
            -Manufacturer 
        - Automobile 
            -Color
            -Year
            -VIN
            -Model
    2. Sales
        - Sales Rep
            -Name
            -Employee number
        - Customer 
            -Name
            -Address
            -Phone number
        - AutomobileVO
            -VIN
            -Import href
        - Sales Record
            -Automobile
            -Sales Rep
            -Customer
            -Price
    3. Service
        - Technician
            -Name
            -Employee number
        - AutomobileVO
            -VIN
        - Service
            -VIN
            -Customer
            -Date and time
            -Technician
            -Reason
            -VIP status
            -Completion status

These three bounded contexts are connected with the Automobile model in the Inventory microservice. Both sales and service needed to poll data from Automobile to use in their own microservice. 


## Service microservice

The service microservice will have 3 models: Technician, Service and AutomobileVO. 

    1. Technician
        - The Technician model will allow an employee to create a technician with a name and employee number. The employee number has to be unique. 

    2. AutomobileVO
        - The AutomobileVO model will poll data from the Inventory microservice so the Service microservice has access to the automobile's VIN. 

    3. Service
        - The Service model will allow an employee to create a service appointment. To create a service appointment, you need the car's VIN, customer name, date and time, technician completing the service, and the reason for the appointment. 

        - The Service model also has two additional properties: is_vip and is_finished
            - is_vip is how I am able to track if an automobile was in our inventory. When the service form is submitted, if the VIN entered matches a VIN that was in our inventory, then that customer will receive VIP treatment since they bought their automobile from our dealership. 
            - is_finished is how the completion of service is tracked. In the list of services, once you click on the "Finished" button, then it will update is_finished to be true. The service appointment will then show up on the Service History page. 

        - Service history 
            - The service history page is where all the completed services are listed. They are filtered by VINs. Once you type a VIN in the search bar, it will update the list to show which services have been completed for that automobile. If the service has not been completed yet, then it will not show up on the Service History page. 

        - Cancel a service
            - You can cancel a scheduled service by clicking the cancel button, which will delete the appointment from the database. 

My thought process starting the project: 
I will install the service app into the inventory microservice and make my models and views to show the list of my model. I will write the paths to my views and check my work on Insomnia. I will add to my view function to handle POST requests. That will complete my back end. Then I will begin on the front-end by polling for the automobiles for the vin. Then I will begin creating my React files and building my React components to fetch and show the lists and complete the forms. I will implement the delete request for the cancel button and d-none for my finished projects. Then I will work on the search bar for the service history. 

## Sales microservice

Inside of the sales microservice I have 4 models. My AutomobileVO so I can poll for the VIN numbers for the cars in my inventory and thus making this entire thing function. Creation of a customer and a sales rep is mandatory as well but are things that can stand alone so not much to worry about there. Now the sales records are where the fun begins. The sales records' only stand alone piece of information is the fact that you set the price. The rest of it is using data provided from the sales rep list, the customer list, and the Automobile VIN numbers we polled in the beginning. Then and only then can you create a proper sales record. We also included a targeted sales record list so that way you can check the sales records of specific employees without having to read every sales record. Creation posts our data we have ways to get it with the use of the lists and if you need to delete something we included our models in the admin section.
