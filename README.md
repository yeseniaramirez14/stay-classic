## Design
There are three bounded contexts: Inventory, Service and Sales.
- These bounded contexts are connected through the Automobile model in the Inventory microservice. Both sales and services needed to poll data from Automobile to use in their own microservice.

<a name="service"></a>
<ins>Service microservice</ins>

The service microservice will have 3 models: AutomobileVO, Technician, Service. 

<b>AutomobileVO</b>
- The AutomobileVO model will poll data from the Inventory microservice so the Service microservice has access to the automobile's VIN. 

<b>Technician</b>
- The Technician model will allow an employee to create a technician with a name and employee number. The employee number has to be unique. 

<b>Service</b>
- The Service model will allow an employee to create a service appointment. The employee will need the car's VIN, customer name, date and time, technician completing the service, and the reason for the appointment. 

- The Service model also has two additional properties: is_vip and is_finished
    - is_vip is how the employee is able to track if an automobile was in their inventory by the automobile's VIN. The customer will receive VIP treatment on their service appointment if they bought their automobile from Stay Classic Dealership.
    - is_finished is how the completion of service is tracked. Once a service is completed then it will be shown on the Service History page.

- Service history 
    - The service history page is where all the completed services are listed. They are filtered by VINs. Once you type a VIN in the search bar, it will update the list to show which services have been completed for that automobile. If the service has not been completed yet, then it will not show up on the Service History page. 

- Cancel a service
    - You can cancel a scheduled service by clicking the cancel button, which will delete the appointment from the database. 

<br>
<a name="sale"></a>
<ins>Sales microservice</ins>

- Inside of the sales microservice, I have 4 models. My AutomobileVO model so I can poll for the car's VINs in my inventory. The SalesRep and Customer model are required before you can create a sales record. The Sales Record model is dependent on all three other models. 
- A Targeted Sales Record list is available so the employee can check the sales records of a specific sales rep.
